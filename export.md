# FHIR Bulk Data Export API Proposal

## Request Flow

### Authorization

Bulk data servers should implement the OAuth based [SMART backend services](./authorization.md) authorization process. On the requests outlined below, clients should include an ```Authorization``` header containing the bearer token received from the authorization flow. If the server responds to a request with a ```401 Unauthorized``` header, the client should follow the authorization flow to obtain a new token.

---
### Bulk Data Kick-off Request

This FHIR Operation initiates the asynchronous generation of data files for all patients or a group of patients contained in a FHIR server.

Note: Only data the client application has authorization to access and that the relevant business agreements allow should be returned.

#### Endpoint - All Patients

```GET [fhir base]/Patient/$export```

#### Endpoint - Group of Patients

```GET [fhir base]/Group/[id]/$export```

FHIR Operation to obtain data on all patients listed in a single [FHIR Group Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/group.html). Note: How these groups are defined will be implementation specific for each clinical system. For example, a payer may send a healthcare institution a roster file that can be imported into their EHR to create or update a FHIR group. FHIR based roster management is out of scope for the bulk data project, but would be a valuable project.

#### Headers

- ```Accept``` (required)

  Specifies the format of the optional OperationOutcome response to the kick-off request. Currently, only application/fhir+json is supported.

- ```Prefer``` (required)

  Specifies whether the response is immediate or asynchronous. Currently must be set to ```respond-async```.

#### Query String Parameters

- ```_outputFormat``` (string, optional, defaults to ```application/fhir+ndjson```)

  The format for the generated bulk data files. Currently, only [ndjson](http://ndjson.org/) is supported. Servers should support the full content type of ```application/fhir+ndjson``` as well as abbreviated representations including ```application/ndjson``` and ```ndjson```.

- ```_since``` (FHIR instant type, optional)  

  Resources updated after this period will be included in the response

  Note: This parameter was named ```start``` in an earlier version of this proposal

- ```_type``` (string of comma-delimited FHIR resource types, optional)

  Only resources of the specified resource types(s) will be included in the response. If this parameter is omitted, the server should return all supported resources that the client has authorization to access and that the relevant business agreements allow. The [Patient Compartment](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/compartmentdefinition-patient.html) should act as a point of reference for recommended resources to be returned as well as other resources outside of the patient compartment that are helpful in interpreting the patient data such as Organization and Practitioner.

  Note: Some implementations may limit the resources returned to specific subsets of FHIR like those defined in the [Argonaut Implementation Guide](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/)

#### Response - Success

- HTTP Status Code of ```202 Accepted``` 
- ```Content-Location``` header with a url for subsequent status requests
- Optionally a FHIR OperationOutcome in the body

#### Response - Error (eg. unsupported search parameter)

- HTTP Status Code of ```4XX``` or ```5XX```
- Optionally a FHIR OperationOutcome in the body

---
### Bulk Data Delete Request:

After a bulk data request has been kicked-off, clients can send a delete request to the url provided in the ```Content-Location``` header to cancel the request.

#### Endpoint 

```DELETE [polling content location]```

#### Response - Success

- HTTP Status Code of ```202 Accepted```
- Optionally a FHIR OperationOutcome in the body

#### Response - Error Status

- HTTP status code of ```4XX``` or ```5XX```
- Optionally a FHIR OperationOutcome in the body

---
### Bulk Data Status Request:

After a bulk data request has been kicked-off, clients can poll the url provided in the ```Content-Location``` header to obtain the status of the request.

Note: Clients should follow the an [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff) approach when polling for status. Servers may supply a [Retry-After header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After) with a http date or a delay time in seconds. When provided, clients should use this information to inform the timing of future polling requests.

#### Endpoint 

```GET [polling content location]```

- if an Accept header is provided, it should have a value of application/json, but the server should respond the same either way

#### Response - In-Progress Status

- HTTP Status Code of ```202 Accepted```
- Optionally an ```X-Progress``` header with a text description of the status of the request that's less than 100 characters. The format of this description is at the server's discretion and may be a percentage complete value or a more general status such as "in progress". Clients can try to parse this value, display it to the user, or log it.
- Optionally a FHIR OperationOutcome in the body

#### Response - Error Status

- HTTP status code of ```5XX```
- Optionally a FHIR OperationOutcome in the body

#### Response - Complete Status

- HTTP status of ```200 OK```
- ```Content-Type header``` of ```application/json```
-  Optionally an ```Expires``` header indicating when the files listed will no longer be available.
- A body containing a json object providing metadata and links to the generated bulk data files.

  Required Fields:
  - ```transactionTime``` - a FHIR instant type that indicates the server's time when the query is run. No resources that have a modified data after this instant should be in the response.
  - ```request``` - the full url of the original bulk data kick-off request
  - ```secure``` - boolean value indicating whether downloading the generated files will require an authentication token. Note: This may be false in the case of signed S3 urls or an internal file server within an organization's firewall.
  - ```output``` - array of bulk data file items with one entry for each generated file. Note: If no data is returned from the kick-off request, the server should return an empty array. 
  
  Each file item should contain the following fields:
   - ```type``` - the FHIR resource type that is contained in the file. Note: Each file may only contain resources of one type, but a server may create more than one file for each resources type returned. The number of resources contained in a file is may vary between servers. If no data is found for a resource, the server should not return an output item for it in the response.
   - ```url``` - the path to the file. The format of the file should reflect that requested in the ```_outputFormat``` parameter of the initial kick-off request.
    
	Example response body:
    
	```json
    {
      "transactionTime": "[instant]",
      "request" : "[base]/Patient/$export?_type=Patient,Observation", 
      "secure" : true,
      "output" : [{
        "type" : "Patient",
        "url" : "http://serverpath2/patient_file_1.ndjson"
      },{
        "type" : "Patient",
        "url" : "http://serverpath2/patient_file_2.ndjson"
      },{
        "type" : "Observation",
        "url" : "http://serverpath2/observation_file_1.ndjson"
      }]
    }
    ```

---
### File Requests:

Using the urls supplied in the completed status request body, clients can download the generated bulk data files (one or more per resource type). Note: These files may be served by a file server rather than a FHIR specific server. Also, if the ```secure``` field in the status body is set to ```true``` the request must include a valid access token in the ```Authorization``` header in these requests.

#### Endpoint 

```GET [url from status request output field]```

#### Headers

- ```Accept``` (optional, defaults to ```application/fhir+ndjson```)

Specifies the format of the file being returned. Optional, but currently only application/fhir+ndjson is supported.

#### Response - Success

- HTTP status of ```200 OK```
- ```Content-Type``` header of ```application/fhir+ndjson```
- Body of FHIR resources in newline delimited json - [ndjson](http://ndjson.org/) format

#### Response - Error

- HTTP Status Code of ```4XX``` or ```5XX```

## Out of scope in v1 of this specification

- Legal framework for sharing data between partners - BAAs, SLAs, DUAs should continue to be negotiated out-of-band 
- Real-time data (although data loaded through bulk data can be supplemented at with synchronous FHIR REST API calls)
- Data transformation and transmission - different step of the ETL process
- Patient matching (although, itâ€™s possible to include identifiers like subscriber number in FHIR resources)
- Management of FHIR groups within the clinical system - the bulk data operation will require a valid group id, but does not specify how FHIR Groups resources are created and maintained within a system
